-------------TIME COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS-----------

Push  → O(1)
Pop   → O(1)
Peek  → O(1)

Balanced Parentheses Check → O(n)

Explanation:
- Push, Pop, Peek operate on top of stack ie constant time.
- Balanced parentheses requires traversing entire string ie linear time.



-----------------Conclusion--------------------

Stack is a linear data structure that follows LIFO principle.
It is widely used in function calls, expression evaluation,
undo/redo operations, and syntax checking.
Push and Pop operations are efficient with O(1) complexity.
Understanding stack helps solve many real-world problems efficiently.



-------------APPLICATION BASED QUESTIONS-------------------

1 How is Stack used in Function Calls (Call Stack)?

Stack is used in program execution to manage function calls.
Whenever a function is called, a block of memory is created
and pushed into the call stack.

This block contains:
• Local variables
• Function parameters
• Return address

When the function finishes execution,
its memory block is popped from the stack.

Since stack follows LIFO (Last In First Out),
the last function called is the first one to finish.

Example:
If main() calls fun1()
and fun1() calls fun2()

Stack Order (Top to Bottom):
fun2()
fun1()
main()

When fun2() completes, it is removed first.
This mechanism is known as Call Stack.


--------------------------------------

2 How is Stack used in Undo/Redo Operations?

Undo and Redo features in applications like
text editors use two stacks:

1. Undo Stack
2. Redo Stack

Working:

• When user performs an action,
  it is pushed into the Undo stack.

• When user presses Undo,
  the last action is popped from Undo stack
  and pushed into Redo stack.

• When user presses Redo,
  the last undone action is popped from Redo stack
  and pushed back into Undo stack.

This works efficiently because stack follows
Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.


--------------------------------------

3 Why is Stack useful in Expression Evaluation?

Stack is useful in expression evaluation because:

• It helps maintain operator precedence.
• It helps handle nested parentheses.
• It allows storing operands and operators temporarily.

Applications:
• Infix to Postfix conversion
• Postfix expression evaluation
• Checking balanced parentheses

Example:
In expression A + B * C
Multiplication (*) has higher precedence,
so stack helps process it first.

Thus, stack ensures correct order of operations.

4 Differentiate between Infix, Prefix, and Postfix Expressions

Infix Expression:
• Operator is written between operands.
• Example: A + B
• Requires parentheses to maintain precedence.

Prefix Expression:
• Operator is written before operands.
• Example: + A B
• Does not require parentheses.

Postfix Expression:
• Operator is written after operands.
• Example: A B +
• Does not require parentheses.

Comparison:

Infix  → Operator in middle
Prefix → Operator at beginning
Postfix → Operator at end

Prefix and Postfix are easier for computers to evaluate
because they do not need brackets.
