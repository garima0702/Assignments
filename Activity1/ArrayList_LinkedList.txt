----------------Concept Analysis (Group Activity)--------------
Instructions: Form groups of 3–4 students and complete the table below.
Feature	                            ArrayList	        LinkedList
Internal Structure	                Dynamic Array	    Doubly Linked List
Access Time Complexity	            O(1)	            O(n)
Insertion Time Complexity	        O(n)	            O(n)
Deletion Time Complexity	        O(n)	            O(1) if position is known
Memory Usage	                    Less	            More
 
------------Choose the correct data structure for:-------------
1. Student record system - ArrayList
2. Browser history - LinkedList
3. Online shopping cart – ArrayList
4. Undo/Redo feature – Linked List


-------------Viva Questions----------------


1. Why is ArrayList access faster?
Answer:ArrayList stores elements in a continuous array.Because of index
-based access, any element can be accessed directly using its index, which makes access time O(1).

Q2. Why does LinkedList consume more memory?
Answer: LinkedList stores each element in a node that contains data
and a reference to the next node, so extra memory is required for pointers.

Q3. What is the time complexity of insertion at the beginning in SLL?
Insertion at the beginning of a singly linked list is O(1)
because only the head reference is updated.

Q4. Difference between Singly Linked List and Doubly Linked List
Singly Linked List: each node has data and reference to next node only.
Doubly Linked List: each node has data, reference to previous and next node.
Doubly linked list uses more memory but allows two-way traversal.

Q5. What is RandomAccess interface?
RandomAccess is a marker interface in Java that indicates
a list supports fast index-based (random) access.
ArrayList implements RandomAccess, LinkedList does not.
