------------Key Concept---------------------------------

| Data Structure | Best at                            | Weak at                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
|   ArrayList    | Fast access using index (`get(i)`) | Slow insert/delete in middle |
|   LinkedList   | Fast insert/delete anywhere        | Slow searching               |


---------Scenario Based Analysis----------------------

1. Real-time chat message storage
   → LinkedList
   Reason: Frequent insertions, no need for random access
   Time Complexity: O(1) insertion

2. Music playlist where songs are frequently reordered
   → LinkedList
   Reason: Easy insertion/deletion without shifting elements

3. Student database with frequent searching by index
   → ArrayList
   Reason: Fast index-based access
   Time Complexity: O(1)

4. Browser back and forward navigation
   → LinkedList
   Reason: Easy add/remove from both ends

5. Online exam system storing answers sequentially
   → ArrayList
   Reason: Sequential storage, fast access, rare deletion
     


    
 ------------------Viva Questions-----------
1. Amortized Time Complexity:
   Average time taken over multiple operations.

2. Why ArrayList resizing is expensive?
   Because new array is created and old elements are copied.

3. How LinkedList stores elements?
   As nodes containing data and reference to next node.

4. Singly vs Doubly Linked List:
   Singly → one pointer
   Doubly → two pointers (prev + next)

5. Space complexity of LinkedList:
   Higher than ArrayList due to extra node references.
